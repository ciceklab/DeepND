# Replicating Results for "Deep multitask learning of gene risk for comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders"

The results of DeepND for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are presented in ["Deep multitask learning of gene risk for comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.150201v3). To replicate the results, you /*must/* have a GPU Server access with at least 70GB memory. Then, a step by step tutorial is as follows:

1. Complete the initialization step as described in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ciceklab/DeepND/blob/master/README.md#installation-guide).
2. Open the /*config*/ file and modify line 16 as "networks = brainspan all".
